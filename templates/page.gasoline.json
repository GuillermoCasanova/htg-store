The Gasoline collection is meant to be a love letter to Los Angeles from Russell Westbrook. <\/p><p>The collection is heavily inspired by Russell’s childhood and the impact of 1990’s “auto-culture” that can be felt on every block here in Los Angeles. As a kid from the Inner City, this collection resonates with his perspective and upbringing from the concrete grit. L.A. summer heat waves, auto shops, family and excessive advertising throughout the city set the backdrop to the Gasoline Collection.<\/p>",
